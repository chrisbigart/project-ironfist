First, we have a stripped-down version of the peasant's frame info, as an example of the least information you can get away with. A peasant with this frame info will stand still and will not fidget, the animation for the blind spell will not be directly over its eyes, and the bar displaying the stack size will be slightly mispositioned, but it will otherwise be fully functioning.

Second, we have a full version of the archer's frame info, as an example of a shooter. Shooters require both melee and ranged attack animations. They also require information to specify which version of their projectile to use when shooting at different angles, how long it takes to fire a projectile, and where their projectile should appear.

Third, we have the phoenix's frame info, as an example of both a flyer and a creature with a two-hex attack. While walkers will stay on a hex for step-time miliseconds and play their movement animation every hex, flyers will move forward smoothly while playing their movement animation, at a rate controlled by their flight speed. However, flyers also require a step-time, as they will move like walkers when slowed. (They will also jerk from one hex to the next.) Flyers always have start-move and end-move animations for liftoff and landind, and are stationary when doing so. Two-hex attackers also require two versions of each melee attack animation, a normal one, and one for when the two-hex attack is used.

Finally, we include the goblin's info as an example of the raw output of the H2FRMUnpack utility, including all ignored and irrelevant fields -- running H2FRMPack on this file will produce a GOBLNFRM.BIN which is not only equivalent to the original, but bit-for-bit equal. Note also that the goblin is one of the only creatures with a sub-start-move animation, played at the beginning of its move animation for every hex except the first.
