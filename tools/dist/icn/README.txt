H2IcnPack and H2IcnUnpack allow you to read, modify, and create the ICN sprite archive files which contain most of the graphics used by Heroes of Might and Magic II.

To unpack a .ICN file: Drag the file onto H2IcnUnpack.exe

To pack a folder into a .ICN file: Drag the folder onto H2IcnPack.exe. Use H2IcnUnpack to see what the folder should look like. All image files must use the Heroes II palette, which can be seen in H2Palette.bmp .

A demonstration of this tool can be seen in the video "Modding with an Iron Fist: Episode 3: Adding New Creatures," http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLEjN6YkvEQ
