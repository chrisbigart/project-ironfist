H2FRMPack and H2FRMUnpack allow you to read, modify, and create the FRM.BIN (creature frame information) files that control the animations of creatures. The "examples" folder contains several good examples of how to create these files.

To unpack an FRM.BIN file: Drag the file onto H2FRMUnpack.exe

To pack an FRM.BIN.ini file: Drag the file onto H2FRMPack.exe

A demonstration of this tool can be seen in the video "Modding with an Iron Fist: Episode 3: Adding New Creatures," http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLEjN6YkvEQ

The Project Ironfist wiki contains detailed descriptions of all creature-frame-information fields: http://projectironfist.pbworks.com/w/page/57740979/Controlling%20Creature%20Animation
